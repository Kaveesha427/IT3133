<h1>ðŸš€React Component and Props</h1>

<div>
<h2>âœ… What are React Components?</h2>

In React, components are like building blocks of your app. You can think of them as reusable functions that return UI elements (HTML-like code called JSX).

There are 2 main types:
<div>
1.Functional Components
</div>
<div>
2.Class Components (less common now)
</div>



<h2>âœ… What are Props?</h2>

Props = "Properties"

They allow you to pass data from one component to another (like function arguments).
